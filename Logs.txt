Logs:


8.12.15: T.G. 
Have uploaded a v0.1 of the game and secured one collaborator.
After a few mods, decided to put v0.1 in stasis and any new changes should be commited as further versions.
Any minor mods should be commited as seperate files. After a while, minor mods shall be collated into one new version of the game.



9.12.15: T.G.
Uploaded possible solution to adding items to the inventory in the easiest way. Need to modify the "item" class.



10.12.15: T.G.
Discovered Cloud 9 workstation system thanks to The-9880. Will use it to develop code and use github to store our work.
Pushed massive update to all systems.  Version 0.2 commited to github.
Changelog:
Developed choice system.
The main game loop seems almost done.
Improved inventory system.
Improved birthing system for new inhabitants.
Initial implementation of hunger and happiness systems.
Initial attempt at Action Points system.
Alpha version of trading system pushed. Pre-alpha. Like it barely even exists. 3 lines of code or something.
Initial Food system.
Player can now create a character. Kind of important to games so glad this is up.
General bug fixes (Syntax errors only)

All code needs massive debugging :( Will develop "broken" versions of all systems and patch them later.
Isn't that how software development works?


14.12.15: T.G.
Pushed v.03 to github. Massive overhaul of some systems and development of many new systems. Code line count doubled! This project is getting complicated fast...
Changelog:
Complete re-working of item system. Now class(item) just needs a name to create itself.
Comparmentalized all the code into seperate "systems" to make development and debugging simpler.
Added create_player function.
Scrapped crafting and room-building systems. Also need to rework room system.
New systems: raiding, scavenging, random item finding/losing, thirst system, hunger system, Action point usage. Informaion systems.
Trading system massively improved.
Imporoved daily loop system.
Improved game loop system.
Minor bug fixes. Emphasis on minor.
Might be some stuff I've forgotten, but it doesn't really matter.

Still no debugging has happened :( 
With the inclusion of all these new systems it's even less likely that this code will run. I don't know what I'm doing.

18.12.15: T.G.
Pushed v.04 to github. Too many changes to list. Basically improved every system. Most notably, completely reworked room system.
Passed 1000 source code line count! The-9880 has done the crafting and scavenging systems.
#NoDebug #ftw #CodeWontRun

29.12.15: T.G.
Been a while since log update. Doesn't mean work wasn't being done. Pushed v0.5 and the game works... Sort of. 
All Syntax errors resolved. Now debugging.
Information, human management and trading systems fully functional.
Other systems quasi-functional. Need more work. Especially room assignment system.

In other news, started using git on local workstations and github to auto-sync code between local stations and cloud spaces (C9!!!)
Passed 1400 code line mark. Project is coming together.

08/02/16: T.G.
Been a while since any log updates. But a lot of work has been done. Most of the systems work. Have switched to PEP-8 style format and moved all the classes to seperate .py files. Mikevb1 has been a huge help.
